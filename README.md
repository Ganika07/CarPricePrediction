Car Price Prediction

Car price prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning. Here we train a car price prediction model with machine learning using Python.Considerable number of distinct attributes are examined for the reliable and accurate prediction. Depending on the factors like name, company, year, Price, kms_driven, fuel_type the price of the car is calculated by the car price predictor. The primary purpose is to design a model for a given dataset and predict the car price with better accuracy.

Regression Algorithms are used because they provide us with continuous value as an output and not a categorized value because of which it will be possible to predict the actual price a car rather than the price range of a car. In this project we built a car price predictor using Linear Regression.Thereby,we can predict the current price of the car in the market. Conclusion Machine learning is a powerful tool for making predictions from data. However, it is important to remember that machine learning is only as good as the data that is used to train the algorithms.
